Sensors with multiple values

Setting up a sensor with multiple measurement values requires multiple consecutive 
configuration topic submissions.

Configuration topic no1: homeassistant/sensor/sensorBedroomT/config
Configuration payload no1: {"device_class": "temperature", "name":
 "Temperature", "state_topic": "homeassistant/sensor/sensorBedroom/state",
  "unit_of_measurement": "Â°C", "value_template": "{{ value_json.temperature}}" }

Configuration topic no2: homeassistant/sensor/sensorBedroomH/config
Configuration payload no2: {"device_class": "humidity", "name":
 "Humidity", "state_topic": "homeassistant/sensor/sensorBedroom/state",
  "unit_of_measurement": "%", "value_template": "{{ value_json.humidity}}" }

Common state payload: { "temperature": 23.20, "humidity": 43.70 }


    Configuration topic: homeassistant/switch/irrigation/config
