# GPIO Setup
#   SERVOPIN - Pin on the raspberry pi that is controlling the servo
#   WHTOPIC - Topic in the MQTT Broker to monitor for commands. (angle)
#   PULSEFREQUENCY - Frequency of the pulses sent to the servo
#                    The servo expects a pulse every 20ms for between 1ms and 2ms
#                    1ms corresponds to an angle of 0 degrees, while a pulse of 2ms
#                    corresponds to an angle of 180 degrees
#                    - A value of 100(Hz) means that the Pi will send a pulse 100 times per 
#                      second, or once every 10ms.
#   PWM0 - The percentage of time that GPIO pin must be "ON" so that 
#           the motor will turn to angle 0
#           The equation for finding the Correct PWM0, or the pulse modulation 
#                     Required to set the servo to angle 0 is:
#                         DutyCycle = PW/T * 100%
#                         D=1ms/20ms*100 = 5
#           For the motor that you use this may have to be tweaked a bit.
#   TRANGEMIN - For scaling MQTT command to the angle.
#                   This is the temperature represented by servo at angle 0.
#   TRANGEMAX - For scaling MQTT command to the angle.
#                   This is the temperature represented by servo at angle 180.
